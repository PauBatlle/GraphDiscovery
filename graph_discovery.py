    """ The main build_graph function, built on top of a networkx directed graph (DiGraph) G
    
    Inputs: 

    X: Dataset, samples of (X1_i, ..., Xn_i), i=1:t. If n variables = nodes in the graph and t timesteps, X is (n x t) numpy array
    ks: Array of kernels, one for each node. Each kernel is a jax vectorized function, so that K(X,X) already builds a matrix with K(X,X)_ij = K(X_i, X_j). See examples
    nugget: the noise σ² of the system, that will be used to detect ancestors
    possible_edges (Default = None): A list of directed edges that could exist (used to discard some prior edges). If None, all edges are possible
    γ1 (Default = 0.5): Threshold to detect ancestors vs noise. Ancestors iff  E_signal > γ1*(E_signal+E_noise)
    γ2 (Default = 0.5): Threshold to detect particular ancestors. Edge to j -> i is removed iff E_without_j > γ2*(E_without_j+E_with_j):
    names (Default = None): The names of the nodes in the graph, for printing and visualization purposes
    verbose (Default = False): Whether to print intermediate results
    plot (Default = False): Whether to plot the graph at the end

    Outputs:

    G: Networkx directed graph
    (Not yet implemented to return the weights of each arrow)
